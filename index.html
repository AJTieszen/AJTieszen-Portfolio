                <h3> About me: </h3>
                <p> My name is Andrew Tieszen. I am currently a senior at CSU Pueblo, pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Engineering, with a focus in mechatronics, and a minor in Computer Information Systems, informally focused on computer programming. Outside of class, I am currently holding a work-study position at the CSUP Innovation Lab, which provides computer tutoring, project help, and 3D printing services to students. I am also involved with Chi Alpha Campus Ministries as a small group leader, and CSUP's Club Climbing Team as a normal member. </p>
                <p> Outside these formal memberships, I participate in a number of hobbies. I am often working on small engineering projects for personal use, many of which appear on my <a href="https://example.com/">portfolio</a> <!--Fix link target when page exists!!-->. Similarly, a few of my game development projects are included at varying stages of completion. I also play my trumpet on Sundays at my local church. More recently, I have regained an interest in outdoor pursuits like camping and hiking, as I have been able to do so. I have also become interested in off-roading, although I have yet to go myself, through watching youtube channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MattsOffRoadRecovery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt's Offroad Recovery</a>. </p>
                <p> ^ Offline edits to the above paragraphs are in progress. </p>
