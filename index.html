                <h3> About me: </h3>
                <p> Currently a senior at <a href="https://www.csupueblo.edu/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Colorado State University Pueblo (CSUP) </a> , Andrew Tieszen is pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Engineering with a focus in Mechatronics and minoring in Computer Information Systems with an informal focus in Computer Programming and Web Development. He is student team leader at the CSUP Innovation Lab, providing computer tutoring, technical project help, and 3D printing services to students. </p>

                <p> At <a href="https://trinidadstate.edu/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Trinidad State Junior College </a> (TSJC, now Trinidad State College), he worked as a help desk technician for the campus IT. department while studying Pre-Engineering for a transfer to CSUP. Prior to that, he spent one year at the <a href="https://www.usafa.af.mil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> United States Air Force Academy </a> in the Electrical And Computer Engineering program. At both TSJC and CSUP, he competed in the Colorado Robotics Challenge, hosted by the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/center/spacegrant/statewide-programs/cosgc-design-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Colorado Space Grant Consortium </a>. He started as a programmer for TSJC's team, consisting of eight to twelve people each year, before being promoted to lead programmer the following year and helping the team win an award for their new project, tracking a rover's movement and mapping any obstacles it encountered. The third and fourth years of competing, he represented CSUP with a single partner, winning an award for innovative locomotion using 3D printed tank tracks. </p>

                <p> Outside work and studies, he is a small group leader for <a href="https://chialpha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Chi Alpha Campus Ministries </a> and a member of the Club Climbing Team at CSUP.
