I did try to center an image, just to see if it would work (This is not present in the current version of the website). The text-align property does not center the image when applied directly to it, but it appears to center images contained within a div containing the property. The proper way to center an image, according to https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_center.asp, is to apply the following CSS to the image element, or a class or id used to identify it:

    display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;

Make sure the image has a width set less than 100%.
