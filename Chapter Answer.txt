Audio may be extremely helpful to include on some websites, especially for its smaller file size compared with video. However, I am not currently planning to keep audio on my portfolio webpage; I simply do not have any relevant audio to include at the moment as images and video are more relevant to my career path. If anything, I might include some sample audio if I add a "hobbies" page, for my trumpet playing.
