 Currently a senior at Colorado State University Pueblo (CSUP) , Andrew Tieszen is pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Engineering with a focus in Mechatronics and minoring in Computer Information Systems with an informal focus in Computer Programming and Web Development. He is student team leader at the CSUP Innovation Lab, providing computer tutoring, technical project help, and 3D printing services to students.

At Trinidad State Junior College (TSJC, now Trinidad State College), he worked as a help desk technician for the campus IT. department while studying Pre-Engineering for a transfer to CSUP. Prior to that, he spent one year at the United States Air Force Academy in the Electrical And Computer Engineering program.

My name is Andrew Tieszen. I am currently a senior at CSU Pueblo, pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Engineering, with a focus in mechatronics, and a minor in Computer Information Systems, informally focused on computer programming. Outside of class, I am currently holding a work-study position at the CSUP Innovation Lab, which provides computer tutoring, project help, and 3D printing services to students. I am also involved with Chi Alpha Campus Ministries as a small group leader, and CSUP's Club Climbing Team as a normal member.

Outside these formal memberships, I participate in a number of hobbies. I am often working on small engineering projects for personal use, many of which appear on my portfolio . Similarly, a few of my game development projects are included at varying stages of completion. I also play my trumpet on Sundays at my local church. More recently, I have regained an interest in outdoor pursuits like camping and hiking, as I have been able to do so. I have also become interested in off-roading, although I have yet to go myself, through watching youtube channels like Matt's Offroad Recovery.
